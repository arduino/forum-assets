This repository is used for collaborative development of the assets of the [Arduino Forum](https://forum.arduino.cc).

The source content and metadata of the assets is stored in the files in this repository. There is additional documentation about the assets in their individual folders.

The development is done via a formal process that allows all interested parties the opportunity to participate in an efficient manner:

1. Create [a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches) to contain your proposed changes.
1. Make your proposed changes to the appropriate file.
1. [Commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) the change to the repository.
1. Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch.
1. Some automated checks will now run on the pull request to make sure there are not any typos, broken links, or style issues. If the check failure doesn't seem correct, feel free to request `@per1234` to investigate.
1. All interested parties will now have the opportunity to [review the pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). They can request changes, make general comments and discussion, or approve the pull request.
1. If any changes have been requested by reviewers, the pull request author can make changes to the pull request's branch and commit them. These commits will automatically be added to the pull request.
1. Once the pull request has been approved, it is [merged](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request) into the `main` branch.
1. The content is published to the Arduino Forum.
