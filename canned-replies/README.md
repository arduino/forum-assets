# Canned Replies

The Arduino Forum has the Discourse "Canned Replies" plugin installed:

https://www.discourse.org/plugins/canned-replies.html

This allows any staff member (moderators and administrators) to select pre-written replies from a menu in the post composer:

![Canned Replies interface](../etc/img/canned-replies.png)

The Canned Replies feature is not enabled for non-staff forum members.

The same canned replies are shared between everyone. So adding or editing a canned reply affects all staff members. They can also improve consistency in [moderation procedures](../moderator-instructions/moderator-instructions.md).

For this reason, it is necessary to follow a formal process for adding or modifying Canned Replies. The source content of the replies is stored in the files under this folder. Proposals for adding or modifying Canned Replies are submitted as [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to add or modify these files. Once the pull request has passed [review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) by the other interested parties, been approved and merged, the Canned Replies on Discourse are updated with the new content.
