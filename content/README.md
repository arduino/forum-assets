## Notes

- The forum contains some areas that are only accessible to staff members (either due to being archived obsolete content or only of use to staff). The content and metadata contains some links to those areas. It is expected that those links will lead to a 404 page if visited when not logged into a forum account with staff privileges. Most of these links are marked "**(private)** in order to prevent confusion.
