# Categorized Content

This folder uses a tree structure based on the Arduino Forum category structure.

## Permissions

The "**See**" (view category and topics), "**Reply**" (reply to topics), and "**Create**" (create topics) permissions of a category can be set for each of [the forum's user groups](https://forum.arduino.cc/g). The permissions of each category are shown in a table in the "**Permissions**" section of the `README.md` file under the category folders.

The special "**everyone**" group is used to set category permissions that are universal to all forum users regardless of the specific groups they are a member of.

## Notes

- The content of the "**About the \_\_\_\_\_ category**" topics is used as the category description in the category listings.
