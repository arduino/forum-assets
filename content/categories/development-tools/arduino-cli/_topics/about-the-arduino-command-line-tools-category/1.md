Welcome to the forum board for Arduino CLI!

Arduino CLI is a tool for [compiling](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/commands/arduino-cli_compile/) and [uploading](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/commands/arduino-cli_upload/) Arduino sketches, [installing libraries](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/commands/arduino-cli_lib/), and [managing boards](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/commands/arduino-cli_core/). It is the heart of the Arduino IDE, Arduino Cloud Editor, and Arduino Pro IDE.

As the "CLI" (command line interface) part of its name suggests, Arduino CLI may be used from the command line. In addition, Arduino CLI provides a [gRPC interface](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/rpc/commands/) and can be used as a Go module, which permits powerful integration with other software.

This forum board is for any questions you have about using Arduino CLI.
