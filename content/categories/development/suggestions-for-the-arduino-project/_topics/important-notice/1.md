While this forum can be used for informal discussions, if you want your suggestions to be
reviewed by the Arduino team, the best way is to use one of the following methods:

- **Bug reports** and **simple enhancement** requests should go on the GitHub issue list:
http://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues

- More complex requests and technical discussion should go on the Arduino Developers
mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!forum/developers

- If you're interested in modifying or extending the Arduino software, we strongly suggest discussing your ideas on the Developers list **before starting** to work on them. That way you can coordinate with the Arduino team and others, giving your work a higher chance of being integrating into the official software
https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!forum/developers

This forum isn't regularly read by Arduino Team and we're considering phasing it out in favor of the options listed above.
