The Nano 33 BLE (without headers) is Arduino’s 3.3V compatible board in the smallest available form factor: 45x18mm!

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE is a completely new board on a well-known form factor. It comes with an embedded 9 axis inertial sensor that makes this board ideal for wearable devices, but also for a large range of scientific experiments in the need of short-distance wireless communication.

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE is an evolution of the traditional Arduino Nano, but featuring a lot more powerful processor, the nRF52840 from Nordic Semiconductors, a 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M4 CPU running at 64 MHz. This will allow you to make larger programs than with the Arduino Uno (it has 1 MB of program memory, 32 times bigger), and with a lot more variables (the RAM is 128 times bigger). The main processor includes other amazing features like Bluetooth® pairing via NFC and ultra low power consumption modes.

The Nano 33 BLE comes with a 9 axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) which means that it includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer with 3-axis resolution each. This makes the Nano 33 BLE the perfect choice for more advanced robotics experiments, exercise trackers, digital compasses, etc.
