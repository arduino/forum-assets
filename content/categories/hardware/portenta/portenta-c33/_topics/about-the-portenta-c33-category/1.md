Portenta C33 is a powerful System-on-Module based on the Renesas RA6M5 microcontroller group.

The Portenta C33 shares the same form factor as the Portenta H7 and is backward compatible with it, making it fully compatible with all Portenta family shields and carriers through its High-Density connectors.
