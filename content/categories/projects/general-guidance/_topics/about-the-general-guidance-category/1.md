Discussion about a project as a whole, both hardware and code

This category is for topics where both the hardware and code of a project will be discussed.

For discussions where only code is directly relevant, use the #projects:programming category.

For discussions about hardware alone, use the category most relevant to the hardware:

- #official-hardware
- #other-hardware
