The [Arduino Create Chrome App for Education](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/arduino-create-for-educat/elmgohdonjdampbcgefphnlchgocpaij) allows students to write code and upload sketches to official Arduino boards.

Arduino Create is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for new boards. Students' sketchbooks are saved on the cloud, always backed up and accessible from any device.
