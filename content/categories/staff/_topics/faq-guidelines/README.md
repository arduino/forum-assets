# FAQ/Guidelines

This content is accessed via [the "FAQ" link](https://forum.arduino.cc/faq) at the top of the forum.

It is also recommended to new users as the "community guidelines" in a message shown on the post composer pane during their first two posts:

> Welcome to Arduino Forum â€” thanks for starting a new conversation!
>
> - Does the title sound interesting if you read it out loud? Is it a good summary?
> - Who would be interested in this? Why does it matter? What kind of responses do you want?
> - Include commonly used words in your topic so others can find it. To group your topic with related topics, select a category (or tag).
>
> For more, see our [community guidelines](https://forum.arduino.cc/guidelines). This panel will only appear for your first 2 posts.

The stock document is provided as part of the Discourse instance and is not Arduino-specific in any way.
