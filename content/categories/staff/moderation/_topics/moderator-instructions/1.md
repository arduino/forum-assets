<a name="policies"></a>

## [Policies](#policies)

Arduino Forum provides a powerful and flexible moderation interface. You may notice that there are other ways to accomplish a given moderation task than the procedures described in this document. In general, you are welcome to use the procedure that is most convenient to you. However, it is essential that all moderation actions are performed in compliance with our policies:

---

<a name="do-not-block-ip-addresses"></a>

### [Do not block IP addresses](#do-not-block-ip-addresses)

You may find that certain parts of the Discourse moderation interface offer the option to block IP addresses of users. This feature _**must not**_ be used.

Although IP blocking may seem useful as a measure to prevent a malicious user from returning with a new account, as a policy we do not block IP addresses. The reason is that a given IP address may be assigned to multiple unrelated people. In this case, a block to prevent one person from using the forum would later cause the others unfortunate enough to have that same IP address to be unjustly blocked from the forum.

If you believe there is a pattern of significant malicious activity associated with a specific IP address, notify the forum manager of the situation.

---

<a name="do-not-delete-accounts"></a>

### [Do not delete accounts](#do-not-delete-accounts)

The Arduino company has [a policy](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/about-user-account-deletion-and-user-content-deletion/627095/5) against deleting user accounts.

---

⚠ The "**Delete User**" options the Discourse moderator interface sometimes presents _**must not**_ be used.

---

[Account suspensions](#suspend-account) are used instead of deletion. Suspension accomplishes the same result of preventing an account from using the forum. In addition, suspension is technically superior in several ways:

- **Reversible:** In the event an error is discovered, suspensions can be easily reversed. Conversely, deletions are irreversible.
- **Records:** Moderators can see valuable information about a user account which may facilitate later moderation work. This information would be lost if the account account was deleted. For example, it is common for users to create a second account to circumvent disciplinary action. The information associated with the previous account allows identification of the second account.

---

<a name="do-not-disclose-private-information"></a>

### [Do not disclose private information](#do-not-disclose-private-information)

In order to facilitate moderation work, the forum's moderator interface provides some information that is not publicly available:

- IP addresses
- geographic data associated w/ IP addresses
- accounts associated by IP address
- identification of users submitting reports
- content of messages submitted with a report
- identification of staff member who performed a moderation action

This information _**must not**_ be shared with anyone other than fellow moderators.

---

<a name="use-flags-to-delete-posts"></a>

### [Use flags to delete posts](#use-flags-to-delete-posts)

---

⚠ The trash can icon ("delete this post" / "delete topic") mechanisms _**must not**_ be used to delete posts and topics.

---

The Arduino company is legally mandated by the [**Digital Services Act**](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en) (DSA) to report on all content deletions performed by moderators (as part of the [DSA Transparency Report](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/policies/dsa-brings-transparency)).

The information that is provided by the review item generated for each flag greatly facilitates the daunting task of producing a report on the thousands of content deletions performed each year by the diligent moderation team.

In addition, flags create an easily accessible record of the moderation action under the user's account. This information about the history of moderation actions can be valuable in identifying patterns of misbehavior which may indicate that additional [disciplinary action](#deal-with-inappropriate-behavior) is required.

For these reasons, we have a policy that [post](#delete-post) and [topic deletions](#delete-topic) must be performed [via the flag mechanism](#flag-post).

---

<a name="flags"></a>

## [Flags](#flags)

Flags are used to bring things to the attention of the moderators. They may be submitted [by forum users](#user-submitted-flags) or [by automated systems](#automated-system-submitted-flags).

Flags are shown on the ["**Review**" page](https://forum.arduino.cc/review). A moderator must review each flag and decide how it should be handled.

<a name="sources-of-flags"></a>

### [Sources of flags](#sources-of-flags)

<a name="user-submitted-flags"></a>

#### [User-submitted flags](#user-submitted-flags)

Users can flag any post by clicking the **⚑** icon. The post may be automatically locked and/or hidden pending review based on the number of flags and ["trust level"](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/) of the flaggers.

When submitting a flag, the user selects the category of the reason for the flag, which is shown on the ["Review" page](https://forum.arduino.cc/review).

<a name="automated-system-submitted-flags"></a>

#### [Automated system-submitted flags](#automated-system-submitted-flags)

The forum software does automated detection of potential problems with user accounts, topics, or posts. These are submitted by one of the forum's official machine user accounts (e.g., **`@system`**).

---

❗ The automated systems are prone to false positives. Please treat these flags as solely a suggestion from the automated system, not as conclusive evidence that something is wrong with the flagged item.

---

<a name="review-flag"></a>
<a name="flag-review-interface"></a>
<a name="review-overview"></a>

### [Review overview](#review-overview)

The moderator must determine multiple separate things when reviewing a flag:

1. Validity of the flag.
1. Conclusion for the flag review.
1. Need for moderation.

The flag review interface provides buttons the moderator can select to agree or disagree with the flag. In some cases, these buttons expand into a menu that provides options for the specific conclusion of the review, as well as offering to perform additional relevant moderation actions (e.g., [suspending account](#suspend-account) of flagged post's author).

<a name="review-conclusion"></a>

#### [Review conclusion](#review-conclusion)

Although the effects of any moderation actions performed in association with the flag review are apparent, less obvious is that the specific conclusion you choose from the flag review interface has [potential implications](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/) (i.e., a "strike") for either the account associated with the flagged item, or the account of the flagger.

There are typically three possible conclusions for a flag review:

| Conclusion | When to Use                                                                                                     | Strike  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Agree      | Flagged item is in violation of the rules.                                                                      | Flaggee |
| Ignore     | Flag is correct, but flagged item does not violate the rules.<br />Flag is incorrect, but raised in good faith. | Nobody  |
| Disagree   | Flag raised in bad faith.<br />E.g.: attempt to weaponize flag system, insincere.                               | Flagger |

<a name="post-flagged-as-off-topic"></a>

### [Post flagged as "Off-Topic"](#post-flagged-as-off-topic)

A topic or post might be considered "off topic" in any of the following respects:

- Topic under [category](https://meta.discourse.org/t/understanding-discourse-for-new-users/96331#p-468221-basic-terms-used-by-discourse-2) that is not appropriate for the subject matter.
- Reply that is on a subject related to Arduino, but outside the scope of the subject of the forum topic.
- Reply that is on a subject unrelated to Arduino.

1. Click the <kbd>**No ▾**</kbd> button.
   A menu will open.
1. If the flag was raised in bad faith, select "**Keep post**" from the menu. If the flag was raised in good faith, select "**Do nothing**".

---

<a name="post-flagged-as-spam"></a>

### [Post flagged as "Spam"](#post-flagged-as-spam)

Flags with the "Spam" reason come from three separate sources:

- Forum users
- The [automated spam detection system](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-ai-spam-detection/343541).
  These flags are raised by the **`@discourse_ai_spam`** user account.
- The "flag_sockpuppets" automated system.
  These flags are raised by the **`@system`** user account.

Since special handling is indicated for the flags from the "flag_sockpuppets" system, the procedures for handling those flags are defined in a separate section of this document: [**here**](#sockpuppets_flag).

The procedures for handling the flags from either of the first two sources are defined below:

---

❗ There are some conditions where mention of products or services is allowed and not considered spam, which are listed [**here**](#exceptions).

---

<a name="if-the-post-is-spam"></a>

#### [If the post is spam](#if-the-post-is-spam)

1. Click the <kbd>**Yes ▾**</kbd> button.

   **ⓘ** The option will have one or the other names depending on whether the flag resulted in the post being automatically hidden.

---

<a name="post-flagged-as-illegal"></a>

### [Post flagged as "Illegal"](#post-flagged-as-illegal)

<a name="post-flagged-as-illegal-moderator"></a>

#### [Procedure for moderators](#post-flagged-as-illegal-moderator)

---

❗ These flags require action by the forum manager so moderators must leave the flag open in the review queue in order to allow the forum manager to effectively track their tasks.

---

1. _Do not_ click any of the buttons in the flag review interface.
1. Perform appropriate moderation of the flagged post and poster account, as usual.

<a name="post-flagged-as-illegal-manager"></a>

#### [Procedure for forum manager](#post-flagged-as-illegal-manager)

---

❗ A notification must be sent for all "**Illegal**" flags, regardless of merit.

---

1. [Review the flag](#review-flag).
1. Take a screenshot of the flagged post.
1. Send notification of report via the channel specified in [the DSA policy document](https://arduino.cc/en/digital-services-act):
   - **If the content was found to be inappropriate:**

     ```text
     A user has flagged an Arduino Forum post as containing illegal content:

     <!-- TODO: flag URL -->

     (the flag is only accessible to forum accounts that have staff privileges)

     Screenshot of the flagged post:

     <!-- TODO: paste screenshot here -->

     The post has been deleted and the post author's forum account permanently suspended.
     ```

   - **If the content was found to be acceptable:**

     ```text
     A user has flagged an Arduino Forum post as containing illegal content:

     <!-- TODO: flag URL -->

     (the flag is only accessible to forum accounts that have staff privileges)

     Screenshot of the flag:

     <!-- TODO: paste screenshot here -->

     The flagged post:

     <!-- TODO: post URL -->

     After a review, the flagged post was determined to not contain illegal content and thus the post was not subjected to moderation, nor the post author to disciplinary action.
     ```

---

**ⓘ** The link to the flag is available from the timestamp at the top of the review queue item.

---

<a name="post-flagged-as-something-else"></a>

### [Post flagged as "Something Else"](#post-flagged-as-something-else)

The user submitting a "**Something Else**" flag will provide a message explaining the purpose of the flag. This might be used to flag problematic posts that don't fit into any of the standard user-submitted flag categories, or simply as an efficient means of communicating with the moderators about a benign post (e.g., requesting a tutorial topic be closed to discussion).

<a name="post-flagged-as-something-else-violation"></a>

#### [If the post violates the rules](#post-flagged-as-something-else-violation)

1. Click the <kbd>**Yes ▾**</kbd> button.
   A menu will open.
1. The menu contains a variety of options that provide additional moderation actions beyond agreeing with the flag. Select the appropriate option from the menu.
1. If the flag requires additional action (e.g., [merging cross-post topics](#deal-with-cross-post)), following the relevant instructions provided elsewhere in this document to perform that action.

---

<a name="post-flagged-as-something-else-benign"></a>

#### [If the post does not violate the rules](#post-flagged-as-something-else-benign)

1. Click the <kbd>**No ▾**</kbd> button.
   A menu will open.
1. If the flag was raised in bad faith, select "**Keep post**" from the menu. If the flag was raised in good faith, select "**Do nothing**".
1. If the flag requires additional action (e.g., [reopening a closed topic](#reopen-auto-closed-topic)), following the relevant procedures defined elsewhere in this document to perform that action.

---

<a name="needs-approval-flag-for-account"></a>

### ["Needs Approval" flag for account](#needs-approval-flag-for-account)

This flag is created by **`@system`** when a user account creation is detected as possibly malicious. The account must be reviewed by a moderator.

<a name="if-the-account-is-malicious"></a>

#### [If the account is malicious](#if-the-account-is-malicious)

---

⚠ There is a strict [policy prohibiting the deletion of accounts](#do-not-delete-accounts), so you _**must not**_ use the **Yes > Delete User** or **Yes > Delete and Block User** options Discourse presents. Always use the procedure defined below to suspend the account.

---

1. Suspend the user account, [following these instructions](#suspend-account)
1. Go back to [the flag review page](https://forum.arduino.cc/review).
1. Click the <kbd>**No**</kbd> button.
   **ⓘ** This is done to clear the flag in a manner compliant with [Arduino's user account policies](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/about-user-account-deletion-and-user-content-deletion/627095). It does not affect the suspension.

---

<a name="if-the-account-is-benign"></a>

#### [If the account is benign](#if-the-account-is-benign)

1. Click the <kbd>**No**</kbd> button.

---

<a name="needs-approval-flag-for-post"></a>

### ["Needs Approval" flag for post](#needs-approval-flag-for-post)

This flag is created by **`@system`** when an automated system determines that a post should be reviewed by a moderator.

The ["**Review**" page](https://forum.arduino.cc/review) presents two buttons to the moderator reviewing a flag of this type:

- **Yes**: Click this button if the flagged item should remain published on the forum.
  **ⓘ** In the case where the post is suitable to be on the forum, but some other moderation action is required (e.g., recategorization), you should click **Yes** button, then proceed with any follow-up actions.
- **No**: The flagged item is not suitable for Arduino Forum and should be deleted.

The name of the specific automated system that triggered the flag will be displayed under the "**Timeline & notes**" section of the review item:

---

<a name="flag-posts-from-reviewable-users"></a>

#### [Flag posts from reviewable users](#flag-posts-from-reviewable-users)

This system flags the initial posts by new users whose account stats match patterns commonly seen in malicious accounts (but are also sometimes present in legitimate accounts). These flags are based solely on the account; not on the post content.

Examine the post and account of the post author for indications of malicious intent. For convenience, a summary of the author's account stats are displayed under the "**Timeline & notes**" section of the review item. You can get additional information about the account from the "**Insights**" tab of the review item, and via [the standard methods for investigating a user](#investigate-user).

<a name="flag-posts-from-reviewable-users-malicious"></a>

##### [If the post is malicious](#flag-posts-from-reviewable-users-malicious)

1. Click the <kbd>**No ▾**</kbd> button.

<a name="flag-posts-from-reviewable-users-benign"></a>

##### [If the post is benign](#flag-posts-from-reviewable-users-benign)

1. Click the <kbd>**Yes**</kbd> button.

---

<a name="flag-posts-in-uncommon-language"></a>

#### [Flag posts in uncommon language](#flag-posts-in-uncommon-language)

This system flags posts written in a language that is rarely used for legitimate activity.

Examine the post and account of the post author for indications of malicious intent.

<a name="flag-posts-in-uncommon-language-malicious"></a>

---

##### [If the post is malicious](#flag-posts-in-uncommon-language-benign)

1. Click the <kbd>**No ▾**</kbd> button.
   A menu will open.
1. Select "**Reject and Suspend user**" from the menu.

---

<a name="flag-topics-with-inappropriate-language-category"></a>

#### [Flag topics with inappropriate language category](#flag-topics-with-inappropriate-language-category)

This system flags topics which are determined to miscategorized for the language of the post. These flags are only intended to bring the miscategorization to the attention of the moderators and do not indicate there is something malicious about the topic.

1. Check the categorization of the topic. If it is miscategorized follow the ["**Move topic to correct category**" instructions](#move-topic-to-correct-category).
1. Click the <kbd>**Yes**</kbd> button on the review item.

---

<a name="sockpuppets-flag"></a>

### [Flags from "flag_sockpuppets" system](#sockpuppets-flag)

These flags have the "Spam" reason. However, they are raised based on attributes of the post author's account, not based on the post content.

These flags are automatically raised by the **`@system`** user account when a new user replies on the topic created by another user with the same IP address. This might indicate that the topic author created a second account for deceptive purposes (this is referred to as a "[sock puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account)").

---

⚠ Legitimate users may happen to be assigned the same IP address. Be sure to carefully evaluate the flagged posts and user accounts before taking any administrative action.

## [Guides](#guides)

Instructions for dealing with specific common occurrences.

---

<a name="deal-with-inappropriate-behavior"></a>

### [Deal with inappropriate behavior](#deal-with-inappropriate-behavior)

<a name="context"></a>

##### [Context](#context)

Although some forms of inappropriate behavior (e.g., malicious [spam](#delete-spam), hate speech) should always result in an immediate [account suspension](#suspend-account), there are other cases where the user can be encouraged to follow the forum rules and become a responsible member of the community. In these cases, the history of moderation actions against the user can provide important context for determining the appropriate action to take in response to the current violation.

The [**"Investigate user" instructions**](#investigate-user) explain how to access this information.

<a name="tools"></a>

##### [Tools](#tools)

The moderation system offers several tools to deal with inappropriate behavior, listed below in order of increasing severity:

- [**User Notes**](#add-user-note) - documenting inappropriate behavior or even suspicions of malicious intent (e.g., generic replies used to prepare a [spam](#delete-spam) account) generates [the history](#context) that will allow moderators to determine the appropriate level of action to take in response to future violations.
- [**Staff Post**](#make-staff-post) - mark a moderator's reply regarding inappropriate behavior as an official proclamation.
- [**Trust Level**](#adjust-user-trust-level) - reduce the user's "Trust Level" to put automated limits on their forum use.
- [**Silence User**](#silence-user) - block the user from making new posts, flags, or PMs.
- [**Suspend User**](#suspend-account) - block the user from logging in.

---

<a name="delete-spam"></a>

### [Delete spam](#delete-spam)

In addition to the reports via [flags](#flags), you may also encounter spam while [investigating users](#investigate-user) or browsing the forum. These are the instructions for directly removing spam and spammers from the forum.

---

⚠ [Always use the flag mechanism when directly deleting posts and topics](#use-flags-to-delete-posts). _**Do not**_ use the alternative trash can icon ("delete this post" / "delete topic").

---

<a name="exceptions"></a>

##### [Exceptions](#exceptions)

Mentions of relevant products or services of interest to the Arduino community are allowed in:

- Topics in the ["**Products and Services**" category](https://forum.arduino.cc/c/community/products-and-services/41).
- Replies to topics in other [categories](https://forum.arduino.cc/categories) when the intent is to benefit the discussion, rather than solely to advertise.

<a name="move-to-correct-language-category"></a>

### [Move to correct language category](#move-to-correct-language-category)

The Arduino Forum has [dedicated categories for several common non-English languages](https://forum.arduino.cc/c/international/10). When a topic written in one of these languages is created in one of the English language categories of the forum, it should be moved to the appropriate language category. Some of the language categories have subject-specific subcategories which should be used when appropriate.

Topics written in a language for which there is not a dedicated board may be left in the appropriate English language board.

1. If you don't know the language or, in the case of language categories with sub-categories, subject, copy the post text and paste it into [**Google Translate**](https://translate.google.com).
   This will detect the language and allow you to determine the subject matter.
   ❗ It's easy for someone unfamiliar with the language to mistake Portuguese for Spanish.
1. Follow the ["**Move topic to correct category**" instructions](#move-topic-to-correct-category) to move the topic to the appropriate category.

<a name="deal-with-cross-post"></a>

### [Deal with cross-post](#deal-with-cross-post)

A cross-post is when a user posts on the same subject to the forum multiple times. This is harmful because it can lead to wasting the time of people trying to help by unknowingly duplicating the efforts that were made previously in reply to another instance of the cross-post.

1. Open the user's profile page.
   **ⓘ** This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
1. Click the "**Activity**" tab to see their posts.
1. Pick one of the cross-posts to keep.
   If only one cross-post has valuable replies, keep that one. The cross-post that is in the appropriate forum board has preference.
1. Follow the instructions below to [delete](#if-the-post-to-be-removed-has-no-valuable-replies) or [merge](#if-the-post-to-be-removed-has-valuable-replies) the other cross-posts.
1. Add a "[**User Note**](#add-user-note)" to document the rule violation.
   If the user notes indicate a history of repeated cross-posting, take more severe moderation action, as described in the "[**Deal with inappropriate behavior**](#deal-with-inappropriate-behavior)" instructions.
1. In a reply to the cross-post to be kept, add a ["Staff Post"](#make-staff-post):
   > I've deleted/merged your other cross-post(s).
   >
   > Cross-posting is against the rules of the forum. The reason is that duplicate posts can waste the time of the people trying to help. Someone might spend 15 minutes (or more) writing a detailed answer on this topic, without knowing that someone else already did the same in the other topic.
   >
   > Repeated cross-posting will result in a suspension from the forum.
   >
   > In the future, please take some time to pick the forum board that best suits the topic of your question and then only post once to that forum board. This is basic forum etiquette, as explained in the [**"How to get the best out of this forum"**](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-this-forum/679966) guide. It contains a lot of other useful information. Please read it.

<a name="if-the-post-to-be-removed-has-valuable-replies"></a>

##### [If the post to be removed has valuable replies](#if-the-post-to-be-removed-has-valuable-replies)

If multiple cross-posts have valuable replies, they must be preserved by merging into a single topic.

---

⚠ The moved posts will be appended to the end of the thread of the topic they are moved to, regardless of the chronology of the posts.

---

1. Open the cross-post's topic.
1. Click the wrench button ("topic actions") at the bottom of the topic.
1. From the menu, select "**Select Posts...**".
   A "**You have selected 0 posts.**" dialog will open.
1. If the entire thread is related to the cross-post, click "**select all**" in the dialog. If the cross-post was a [thread hijack](#split-hijacked-topic), then click the <kbd>**select**</kbd> button on each post related to the cross-post.
1. Click the <kbd>**move to**</kbd> button.
   A "**Move to**" dialog will open.
1. Use the "**Search for a Topic**" field to find the cross-post topic to be kept.

<a name="split-hijacked-topic"></a>

### [Split hijacked topic](#split-hijacked-topic)

A topic hijack is when a user makes a reply that is not relevant to the topic. This can either result in a confusing thread where there are multiple parallel discussions, or else one of the people needing help being forgotten about.

---

❗ A relevant reply to an old topic is not considered a hijack.

---

**ⓘ** Cross-posts are sometimes done in the form of a hijack. In that case, follow the ["**Deal with cross-post**" instructions](#deal-with-cross-post).

---

1. Open the hijacked topic.
1. Follow the ["**Split topic**" procedure](#split-topic) to move the posts specific to the hijack to a new topic.

<a name="handle-content-deletion-request"></a>

### [Handle content deletion request](#handle-content-deletion-request)

In addition to assisting the immediate recipient, forum helpers hope the benefit of their contributions will be multiplied by serving as a reference for others with similar questions in years to come. For this reason, deletion of forum posts can have a harmful effect. Deletion of the initial post of a topic results in the deletion of the entire topic and the loss of the contributions from all participants. Even in other cases the deletion of a post may result in the loss of the context that gave meaning to replies. So deletion of posts should be avoided when possible in cases where deletion would cause harm.

Deletion requests are often an ["XY problem"](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). If the moderator can find a way to accomplish the user's root goal ("Y") other than their perceived solution of content deletion ("X"), then an outcome is achieved that is better for the forum community, and for the user (since harmful content deletion would result in a permanent suspension of their account).

<a name="content-deletion-handling-overview"></a>

#### [Content deletion handling overview](#content-deletion-handling-overview)

This chart provides an overview of the workflow:

A variety of distinct goals may lay behind a content deletion request. Each goal has its own alternative solution, which are described here:

<a name="redirect-content-deletion-closure"></a>

##### [Closure](#redirect-content-deletion-closure)

The goal behind the request is the user does not want further discussion in their topic.

<!-- Source: https://github.com/arduino/forum-assets/blob/main/content/categories/staff/moderation/_topics/moderator-instructions/_assets/redirect-content-deletion-closure.mmd -->

<a name="redirect-content-deletion-privacy"></a>

##### [Privacy](#redirect-content-deletion-privacy)

The goal behind the request is to avoid the association of the content with the user's username.

<a name="redirect-content-deletion-privacy-moderator"></a>

###### [Procedure for moderators](#redirect-content-deletion-privacy-moderator)

Do not take any further action. Leave further handling and review of the flag to the forum manager. The reason for this is the per-post anonymization procedure that will be used to accomplish the user's privacy goal is only possible with administrative privileges.

⚠ [Always use the flag mechanism when directly deleting posts and topics](#use-flags-to-delete-posts). _**Do not**_ use the alternative trash can icon ("delete this post" / "delete topic").

---

⚠ Be careful not to accidentally [delete the topic](#delete-topic) when you intended instead to only delete the last reply in the thread.

---

⚠ If you delete the first post in the topic, the entire topic will be deleted. In the case where there is valuable information in replies on the topic, consider alternative approaches that will not result in the loss of those valuable contributions:

- Instead of deleting the post, [edit out the unacceptable content](#edit-post).
- [Split the valuable replies out to a separate topic](#split-topic) prior to deleting the problematic topic.

---

1. Follow the ["**Flag post**" instructions](#flag-post), deleting the post through the resolution of the flag.

---

1. Follow the ["**Flag post**" instructions](#flag-post) to flag the first post of the topic. Delete the topic through the resolution of the flag.

---

<a name="edit-post"></a>

### [Edit post](#edit-post)

A otherwise valuable post may contain unwanted content. For example:

- incidental profanity
- content rendered obsolete by moderation

In this case, the unwanted content should be edited out of the post rather than deleting the post.

1. Click the **⬤⬤⬤** icon at the bottom of the post.
   Additional icons will appear.
1. Click the pencil icon ("edit this post") at the bottom of the post.
   The post will open in the post composer panel.

   If a "**Take Action... ▾**" button did not appear, or if you do not wish to immediately resolve the flag, click the "**:black_flag: Flag Post**" button. This will add the flag to the review queue, from which it can be [resolved as usual](#user-submitted-flags).

---

<a name="investigate-user"></a>

### [Investigate user](#investigate-user)

It is frequently necessary for moderators to investigate an account to determine whether moderation action is warranted, and which level of action. This might be done to determine whether:

- the user's intentions are benign or malicious (e.g., a [spammer](#delete-spam) making seemingly innocent posts to prepare an account).
- the user has a history of [inappropriate behavior](#deal-with-inappropriate-behavior), which would indicate a more severe level of action is needed.
- a previous moderation action was warranted or in error in response to a report from the user of an inappropriate moderation action.

The forum software provides some useful tools for investigating a user:

<a name="user-notes"></a>

#### [User Notes](#user-notes)

This is the tool used by staff and automated systems to store documentation related to a user account.

---

❗ User Notes are generated by [flags](#automated-system-submitted-flags) submitted by automated systems. These flags are regularly false positives. So be cautious in assigning importance to User Notes written by the **`@system`** user.

---

1. Open the user's profile page. This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
1. Click the <kbd>**User Notes**</kbd> button.

<a name="user-activity"></a>

#### [User activity](#user-activity)

This shows the user's posts, which can be used to find unreported inappropriate behavior (e.g., cross-posting, [spam](#delete-spam)).

1. Open the user's profile page.
   **ⓘ** This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
   - If any of their posts have been deleted, there will be a black bar at the top of the user profile "**Summary**" page with a "**deleted posts**" link. Click that link to see the deleted posts.
   - Click the "**Activity**" tab to see their other posts.

<a name="ip-lookup"></a>

#### [IP Lookup](#ip-lookup)

This tool allows you to see all the accounts associated with the user's [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address), which can be used to determine whether the user has other accounts (e.g., circumventing a [suspension](#suspend-account), [sock puppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account)).

1. Open the user's profile page.
   **ⓘ** This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
1. Click the <kbd>**Admin**</kbd> button.
1. Click the <kbd>**🌐 IP Lookup**</kbd> button.
1. Check whether any other accounts are listed under the "**Other accounts with this IP address**" section.

<a name="action-logs"></a>

#### [Action Logs](#action-logs)

This shows all staff actions that affected the user's account. The [User Notes](#user-notes) will generally contain entries for all important actions, as well as manually added notes, so check User Notes first.

1. Open the user's profile page.
   **ⓘ** This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
1. Click the <kbd>**Admin**</kbd> button.
1. Click the <kbd>**Action Logs**</kbd> button.

---

<a name="add-user-note"></a>

### [Add User Note](#add-user-note)

"User Notes" provide a place for staff and automated systems to store documentation related to a user account. When a user has "User Notes", a **:memo:** icon is shown next to their user name. This icon can be clicked to view the notes.

---

**ⓘ** Only moderators and administrators can see the icon and the notes. They are not visible to regular users.

---

Documenting inappropriate behavior or even suspicions of malicious intent (e.g., generic replies used to prepare a [spam](#delete-spam) account) generates [the history](#context) that will allow moderators to determine the appropriate level of action to take in response to future [inappropriate behavior](#deal-with-inappropriate-behavior).

---

<a name="user-notes-specific-to-a-post"></a>

#### [User Notes specific to a post](#user-notes-specific-to-a-post)

User notes can be associated with a post. These are the same as the [User Notes general to an account](#user-notes-general-to-an-account), except that the User Note will have a button that links to the post.

1. Click the **⬤⬤⬤** icon at the bottom of the post.
1. Click the wrench icon.
1. Click "**Add User Note**".
1. Write the User Note.
1. Click the <kbd>**Add User Note**</kbd> button.

1. Click the <kbd>**Add User Note**</kbd> button.

---

<a name="make-staff-post"></a>

### [Make staff post](#make-staff-post)

Moderators can mark their posts with a "Staff Color", which is intended to give it emphasis as an official proclamation.

---

**ⓘ** This is not the same as the similarly named "Staff Notice". Due to serving no useful purpose, "Staff Notices" should not be used.

---

1. Make a post as usual, whether that be a topic or reply.
1. Click the **⬤⬤⬤** icon at the bottom of the post to be given the "Staff Color".
1. Click the wrench icon.
1. Click "**Add Staff Color**".

---

<a name="adjust-user-trust-level"></a>

### [Adjust user Trust Level](#adjust-user-trust-level)

The user's privileges on the forum are dependent on their "Trust Level" (TL). The forum software automatically raises or lowers trust levels based on user stats. In cases where the automatically set trust level doesn't match the privileges appropriate for a user, the moderators can manually adjust the Trust Level. This can serve as a tool for putting some limits on the user's forum activity while still allowing them to participate.

Detailed information about Trust Levels: https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/

1. Open the user's profile page.
   **ⓘ** This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
1. Click the <kbd>**Admin**</kbd> button.
1. From the "**Permissions**" section, click the "**Trust Level**" dropdown menu.
1. Select the desired level from the menu.
1. Click the <kbd>**✓**</kbd> button.
1. If you would like to prevent the automated adjustment of trust level by the forum software, click the <kbd>**Lock Trust Level**</kbd> button.
   If the trust level was previously locked and you want to unlock it, then click the <kbd>**Unlock Trust Level**</kbd> button.

---

<a name="silence-user"></a>

### [Silence user](#silence-user)

The "Silence" action is used in cases where the intent is to temporarily curtail a user's forum activity in response to [inappropriate behavior](#deal-with-inappropriate-behavior), with the intent to later restore their privileges in hopes they can be reformed to a responsible member of the forum community.

---

❗ In cases where the intent is to permanently exclude the user from the Arduino Forum, the account should instead be ["Suspended"](#suspend-account).

---

If the account is to be silenced as part of handling a [flag](#flags), the silencing is accomplished efficiently via the flag resolution dialog.

Likewise, if the silencing is to be performed as the result of a post made by the user, the moderator must [flag that post](#flag-post), and then perform the silencing through the flag resolution.

In certain rare cases, the need might arise to silence an account without there being an associated flag. In this case, the following procedure can be used:

1. Open the user's profile page.
   **ⓘ** This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
1. Click the <kbd>**Admin**</kbd> button.
1. From the "**Permissions**" section, click the <kbd>**Silence**</kbd> button.
1. From the "**Select a timeframe**" dropdown menu, select the desired duration of the silencing.
1. In the "**Silence Reason**" text field, enter a short explanation for the cause for the silencing.
1. Click the <kbd>**Silence**</kbd> button.

---

<a name="split-topic"></a>

### [Split topic](#split-topic)

In some cases, it may be useful to move posts to a dedicated topic.

1. Click the wrench button ("topic actions") at the bottom of the topic.
1. From the menu, select "**Select Posts...**".
   A "**You have selected 0 posts.**" dialog will open.
1. Click the **select** button on each post you wish to move to a new topic.
1. Click the **move to** button.
   The "**Move to**" dialog will open.
1. Type an appropriate title for the subject of the new topic in the "**New Topic Title**" field of the "**Move to**" dialog.
1. Select the appropriate [forum category](https://forum.arduino.cc/categories) from the "**Category**" dropdown menu.

### [Suspend account](#suspend-account)

The user is blocked from logging in to their account when it is suspended.

Account suspensions are used when the intention is to permanently exclude the user from the Arduino Forum.

---

❗ In cases where the intent is to temporarily curtail a user's forum activity in response to [inappropriate behavior](#deal-with-inappropriate-behavior), with the intent to later restore their privileges in hopes they can be reformed to a responsible member of the forum community, they should instead be ["Silenced"](#silence-user).

---

⚠ Arduino has [a policy](#do-not-delete-accounts) against deleting accounts, so you must always suspend instead of deleting accounts.

---

If the account is to be suspended as part of handling a [flag](#flags), the suspension is accomplished efficiently via the flag resolution dialog.

Likewise, if the suspension is to be performed as the result of a post made by the user, the moderator must [flag that post](#flag-post), and then perform the suspension through the flag resolution.

In certain rare cases, the need might arise to suspend an account without there being an associated flag. In this case, the following procedure can be used:

1. Open the user's profile page.
   **ⓘ** This can be accessed by clicking their user name, then the user name in the profile preview popup.
1. Click the <kbd>**Admin**</kbd> button.
1. From the "**Permissions**" section, click the <kbd>**🛇 Suspend**</kbd> button.
1. From the "**Suspend user until**" dropdown menu, select "**Forever**".
1. In the "**Suspension Reason**" text field, enter a short explanation for the cause of suspension (e.g., `spam`).
1. Click the <kbd>**🛇 Suspend**</kbd> button.

### [Change post ownership](#change-post-ownership)

---

❗ The forum framework only allows administrators to change post ownership, so this procedure can not be used by moderators.

---

1. Click the **⬤⬤⬤** icon at the bottom of the post to be transferred.
1. Click the wrench icon.
   A menu will open.
1. Select "**Change Ownership**" from the menu.
   The "**Change Owner**" dialog will open.
1. Select the target account from the "**Please choose a new owner for the post**" field.
1. Click the "**change ownership**" button.
