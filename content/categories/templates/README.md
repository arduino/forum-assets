# Templates

The topics in this category define the ["Discourse Templates"](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-templates/229250). The "templates" provide standardized reusable content for common posts.

Templates are used in posts by clicking the **âš™** icon on the post composer toolbar and then selecting "**Insert template**" from the menu.

The Discourse Templates feature is only available for staff members (moderators and administrators).
