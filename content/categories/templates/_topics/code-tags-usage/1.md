Thank you for posting your code but I am sure you can see that the formatting is a mess. The forum has something called 'code tags', which sort out the problems with the formatting. If you edit your code to include the code tags </>, the code will be easier to read and you will be more likely to get help.

If you are unsure what to do please follow the advice given in the link below when posting code, there are instructions for using code tags, along with lots of other advice to help us to help you.

If you get errors when compiling please copy them from the IDE using the "Copy error messages" button and paste the clipboard here in code tags

Thank you.
