It is against the mores of the Arduino Forum community to delete posts. There are many thousands of people in the Arduino community who need help, and only some dozens who spend their time here providing free assistance and sharing knowledge. The only way that can work is if each helper is able to help many of those seeking assistance. This is accomplished by each forum topic serving as a reference for everyone over the years to come. Deleting the post would result in the loss of that ongoing benefit. Causing such harm to our community would result in the permanent suspension of your account, and surely we don't want that!

However, since you have indicated that you do not wish your user account to be associated with the post, I have transferred its ownership to the forum's utility machine account. That will fully anonymize the post and thus will serve as a suitable resolution.
