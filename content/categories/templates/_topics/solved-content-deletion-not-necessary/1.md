Congratulations on the resolution of your topic!

There is no need to delete the topic. There might be others in the future with the same question who will benefit from the information that is shared. There are many thousands of people in the Arduino community who need help, and only some dozens who spend their time here providing free assistance. The only way that can work is if each helper is able to help many of those seeking assistance. This is accomplished by each forum post serving as a reference for the years to come. Deleting the post would result in the loss of that ongoing benefit. Causing such harm to our community would result in the permanent suspension of your account, and surely we don't want that!
