It is against the mores of the Arduino Forum community to delete topics. There are many thousands of people in the Arduino community who need help, and only some dozens who spend their time here providing free assistance and sharing knowledge. The only way that can work is if each helper is able to help many of those seeking assistance. This is accomplished by each forum topic serving as a reference for everyone over the years to come. Deleting the topic would result in the loss of that ongoing benefit. Causing such harm to our community would result in the permanent suspension of your account, and surely we don't want that!

However, since you have indicated that you no longer wish to continue the discussion, I have closed the topic. That will prevent any further replies and thus will serve as a suitable resolution.
