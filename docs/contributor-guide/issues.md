## Before Reporting an Issue

## Qualities of an Excellent Report

  Vague titles make it difficult to decipher the purpose of the issue when looking through the list of reports, which might result in your issue not being given proper attention.
- Describe the issue and what behavior you were expecting.
- Be responsive.<br />
  We may need you to provide additional information in order to investigate and resolve the issue.<br />
  Make sure your GitHub account is configured so that you will receive notifications of responses to your issue report.
