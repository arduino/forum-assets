# Moderation Guidelines

**Arduino Forum Moderation Guidelines**

**Introduction**
Thank you very much for volunteering your time in helping us to keep our forum organized and enjoyable. The role of a moderator is very important in keeping the community together and helping it remain attractive to new users. Here are some simple guidelines. If you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact one of the Administrators.

Moderators are appointed directly by the Arduino forum Administrators, if you consider the task you are commanding requires too much of your time and you identify other users that could qualify to be good moderators, please let us know.

**Conduct**
Within your own boards of influence, we expect you to act with impeccable manners. Do not belittle members, do not air personal discussions to the public, etc. If you have a problem with a member, PM them or e-mail them and try to keep it at that level.

Outside of your own boards of influence, we expect you to keep the best interests of the members/forums in mind. It is not in the best interest of anybody to start or contribute to flaming/bashing topics. The only result of these topics are general negativity in the forums. It is not necessary nor useful to participate. However, you may choose to act as you will. Generally speaking, we will not sanction you for acting immaturely outside of your boards of influence. However, we will certainly take note of these actions.

**Confidentiality**
It is important that moderators have a place to discuss matters frankly without worrying about confidentiality. We have therefore implemented [a private "Moderation" board](https://forum.arduino.cc/c/staff/moderation/60) where moderators can discuss about issues regarding their position. We expect you to keep all discussions in this board confidential. Even within the Moderation board, it's best not to unnecessarily reveal information shared via private channels (e.g. PMs). If you feel like you will not stick to this, please notify us so that we can remove your moderator access. If we discover that you have breached confidentiality, we will remove you as moderator.

**Forum Duties**
The main thing is to care enough about the Arduino community to make the forum a priority. This will manifest differently per person. If you feel that maintaining your boards of influence has become a burden or that you simply do not have enough time, please notify us and we will remove you as moderator.

Maintaining your part of the forum will necessarily mean regularly visiting to make sure that there is no spam, cross-posting, or other problems to take care of. Also acting when getting moderation requests via email, responding to PMs from users, etc. If you need to take a break from the forums, please ensure that someone else will keep an eye on them during your absence.

It's hard to provide a blanket definition of what taking care of your share of the forum consists of. The important thing is that you are aware of what your board needs and then do it. Please lean on other moderators at the moderation board for support when needed.

**Editing Posts**
There are a lot of occasions when you will need to edit a post. Whenever you do, please insert an edit note at the very end. For example, if a member used an expletive in a post but the rest of the message was of importance, you would want to edit that part out and put a note at the end like "(Edit note: expletive deleted)".

**Language**
No violent, prejudicial language or personal attacks are tolerated in this forum. If you see any inappropriate posts, edit the post immediately. Remove the offending portion or entire post body and insert a edit note explaining your action. Issue a warning.

**Relevancy**
When you found a topic that is not relevant to a board, immediately move it to the appropriate one. Sometimes you should leave a "trail" and sometimes you shouldn't. Try not to leave too many.

**Locking Topics**
When you can foresee that a topic is going downhill, you should lock it. A prime example will be flame wars or totally off topic discussion. However, do not lock topics just because the initial question/concern was answered. It is because although the first question is answered, the thread starter might have another question related to the original one. Bottom line is, don't lock a topic if a normal conversation is going on smoothly (unless it wanders away too far from the original topic).

Whenever you lock a topic, make a reply to briefly explain the reason behind it.

Don't lock topics that have no value (e.g., a cross-post). Just delete it. Locked topics with no value only clutter the forum and waste the time of the forum members.

**Stick Unstick**
Sticky or Unsticky whatever you deem necessary to maintain your board. If there is more than one moderator in your board, consult each other or make a post in the Moderators forum. DON'T just take matters into your own hands

**Announcements**
If you feel an announcement is in order for your board please discuss this with one of the Administrators via PM, IM, team email or a post in the moderator area.

**User Warnings Tracking**
Please use the forum's "Issue Warning" (More... > Issue Warning) feature to log all significant violations of forum rules by users. After issuing a new warning, make sure the "Warning Level" is set to at least 10% so that a "Watched" note will be shown to moderators on the user's posts and forum profile. This will allow all moderators to easily see whether the user is a repeat violator of the forum rules, and adjust their enforcement accordingly.

**Suspensions and Bannings**
Do NOT Perma Ban everyone. Some offenses are more serious than others. We leave this to your own discretion as we believe you can understand what is considered serious and not.

**Multiple Accounts**
If you detect an offender shows up again on a different account, delete one of the accounts.

**Instructions for common moderation tasks**
Detailed instructions for common moderation tasks are provided in the ["Moderation Instructions" topic](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/moderator-instructions/630548).

**Personal Reflection**
I don't really like setting out "rules" and "sanctions". Everyone here are adults and volunteers, and we are not out to herd you around. If there is a problem, however, you don't need to excuse yourself. You are all capable of doing a good job, and if circumstances arise that make it impossible, I expect you to seek help or step down. I don't expect perfection either, but if you care about this forum -your forum- then do a good job.
